👋 Welcome to the Hand Gesture Recognition System Project!

🤖 The goal of this project is to implement a system that can recognize hand gestures and classify them into one of six digits (0-5).

💡 To achieve this, we implemented a complete machine learning pipeline with modules such as preprocessing, feature extraction/selection, model selection and training, and performance analysis.

📚 In order to improve the accuracy of our results, we researched the topic extensively and read research papers related to hand gesture recognition.

💻 We used the Hand Gesture of the Colombian sign language dataset, which can be downloaded from the link provided.

👥 For this project, we only considered the digit classes (0-5) for both men and women datasets.

📊 To evaluate our models, we divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

🧐 While we are free to use any approach or technique we find appropriate for the problem, we used classical machine learning methods such as support vector machines, KNNs, random forest.

🔍 Let's get started and see what combination of techniques will yield the best results!
