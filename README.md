👋 Welcome to the Hand Gesture Recognition System Project!

🤖 The goal of this project is to implement a system that can recognize hand gestures and classify them into one of six digits (0-5).

💡 To achieve this, we will be implementing a complete machine learning pipeline with modules such as preprocessing, feature extraction/selection, model selection and training, and performance analysis.

📚 In order to improve the accuracy of our results, we will research the topic and read research papers related to hand gesture recognition.

💻 We will be using the Hand Gesture of the Colombian sign language dataset, which can be downloaded from the link provided.

👥 For this project, we will only consider the digit classes (0-5) for both men and women.

📊 To evaluate our models, we will divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

🧐 While we are free to use any approach or technique we find appropriate for the problem, we are limited to classical machine learning methods such as Bayesian classifiers, KNN, linear/logistic regression, neural networks (with two hidden layers as a maximum), support vector machines, and principal component analysis.

🔍 Let's get started and see what combination of techniques will yield the best results!
